                Environmental destruction, absurd levels of inequality, growing cynicism and a feeling of powerlessness 
                characterize the state of “late capitalism” we are living in today. 
                The very possibility of collective action is asphyxiatied by the dominant globalized culture of the West, 
                which holds an entrenched belief in the omnipotence of the individual.

                HYPEREXISTENCE is a web essay about this impasse. 
                It articulates the impossibility of participating in contemporary society without taking part in the prevailing 
                culture of individualism. 
                It documents this culture, which manifests itself through the ubiquity of self-expression, 
                through the careful self-branding of public persona, and through the ruthless instrumentalization 
                of others for the acquisition of reputation.
